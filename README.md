# Cyber-classification Project
- This repository contains the code and data for the Cyber-classification project, executed in June 2022 as part of the Data Mining Class at Washington State University, Vancouver. The project's primary objective was to develop a robust classifier model capable of accurately predicting whether a given tweet contains cyberbully context.

- The dataset utilized in this project was obtained from Kaggle and consists of 47,692 rows of tweets sourced from Twitter. Each tweet is labeled based on the type of cyberbullying it represents, including categories such as "age," "gender," "ethnicity," "religion," "other_cyberbullying," or "not_cyberbullying." The dataset was compiled by combining data from six distinct Twitter datasets, ensuring a comprehensive representation of various cyberbullying types.

- The project involved rigorous data mining techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development. The classifier model was trained and evaluated using advanced machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate predictions and robust performance
